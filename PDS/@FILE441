//***FILE 441 is from Brian Vogt of EDS, and contains 2 programs    *   FILE 441
//*           for RACF:                                             *   FILE 441

//*           (1) RESUME - to recover from a situation in which all *   FILE 441
//*               userids with SPECIAL or OPERATIONS attributes     *   FILE 441
//*               have been revoked.  The program runs as a         *   FILE 441
//*               started task, and mimics the effect of a          *   FILE 441
//*               "TSO ALU userid RESUME" command.                  *   FILE 441
//*           (2) RA#NAMES - list all userids & user's names to a   *   FILE 441
//*               data set, and all group ids & installation-data   *   FILE 441
//*               to another data set - (all one-line entries).     *   FILE 441

//*         (1) unset FLAG4 (REVOKE attribute).                     *   FILE 441

//*         (3) set LJTIME & LJDATE to the current time & date.     *   FILE 441

//*        The most likely practical applications are :             *   FILE 441
//*         (a) A hacker revokes all of the privileged userids in   *   FILE 441
//*             the system, by submitting many batch jobs with      *   FILE 441
//*             incorrect passwords.  (Never trust an Operator to   *   FILE 441
//*             reply correctly to message ICH302D).  This program  *   FILE 441
//*             cannot be thwarted, as it does not run under a      *   FILE 441
//*             RACF userid.                                        *   FILE 441

//*         (b) The userid of a production batch job becomes        *   FILE 441
//*             revoked overnight.  The MVS Operator can overcome   *   FILE 441
//*             this, with a bit of information from the on-call    *   FILE 441

//*        (2) The userid (U keyword) must be specified.            *   FILE 441
//*        (3) The password (PW keyword) must match the RVARY       *   FILE 441
